# Heart-disease-classification

Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others.

The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease." Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.

This dataset gives a number of variables along with a target condition of having or not having heart disease. Below, the data is first used in a simple " Support vector machine model and Kernel SVM ", and then the model is investigated using ML explainability tools and techniques.

# Conclusion :

Heart stroke and vascular disease are the major cause of disability and premature death. Chest pain is the key to recognize the heart disease. In this work, the heart diseases are predicted by considering major factors with four types of chest pain. K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Here the datasets are clustered and based upon the clusters the happening of chest pain is predicted. The role of exploratory data using tableau provided a visual appealing and accurate clustering experience.

Classification of heart disease is a noteworthy test in healthcare systems. The classification strategies give significant data to a pathologist for diagnosis and treatment of heart diseases. In this investigation proposed Classification approach, for the most part, classifies the input test data into Healthy or abnormal by utilizing optimal kernel SVM procedure. However, the classification accuracy accomplished is tasteful, assist examinations are required to enhance the classification accuracy. The Optimal kernel accomplishes bring down execution because of the arbitrary estimation of the cost function. Assist examination to upgrade the parameters of the optimal kernel to enhance classification accuracy is to be completed
